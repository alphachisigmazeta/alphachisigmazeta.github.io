## About Alpha Chi Sigma

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/axe-logo.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Alpha Chi Sigma is a unique professional and social fraternity for men and women in the chemical sciences. We are bound by three fraternal objects, which are:
1. To bind its members with a tie of true and lasting friendship.
1. To strive for the advancement of chemistry, both as a science and as a profession.
1. To aid its members by every honorable means in the attainment of their ambitions as chemists throughout their mortal lives.

### Professional:
Being a unique professional fraternity with close ties to the school of chemical sciences, we are able to host many professional activities. Some of these include:

### Why should I join?
<div class="box">
  <p>
There is no other fraternity quite like Alpha Chi Sigma. Ask any one of our active members and they will probably say that joining AXE was one of the best decisions they’ve made in university. Many people join for the benefit their resume receives from our many professional events that we hold, while others do it for the social interaction with colleagues in their field of study. The fraternal bonds that you make by joining are sure to last a lifetime.
